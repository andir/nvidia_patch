nvidia_patch
============

some nvidia fixes i found usefull...

 - running 6x 27" screen each at 2560x1440 as one big X-Server (7680x2880), should be possible to even run 8 with 4 outputs per card but I only have 6 monitors
 
Be aware that i noop'ed out quiet a bit of the binary blob, some stuff is probably not nesscary but I'm happy to have it running at all...
